Welcome to FEniCSx Examples UACh!
====================================

The **FEniCS** package has been very welcomed by the research community as an open-source tool for
implementing numerical solutions of boundary value problems.
At the moment, a new version, called **FEniCSx**, is under development. For the particular reasons, see the paper: `DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10447665 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10447665>`_.

Apart from the
`Dolfinx documentation <https://docs.fenicsproject.org/dolfinx/main/python/index.html>`_, which
already includes a number of demos,
there are excellent tutorials available, for example:

- `Dolfinx Tutorial by Jørgen S. Dokken <https://jsdokken.com/dolfinx-tutorial/index.html>`_
- `Comet-Fenicsx by Jeremy Bleyer <https://bleyerj.github.io/comet-fenicsx/index.html>`_
- `Dolfinx Tutorial @Sorbonne  by Jørgen S. Dokken <http://jsdokken.com/FEniCS23-tutorial/README.html>`_



Using FEniCSx can still be challenging, especially for problems or aspects not covered in existing resources. This website was created to address this issue by curating documented examples relevant to teaching and research at the Universidad Austral de Chile (**UACh**). Additionally, it serves as a source code repository to preserve the insights and knowledge gained from the practical application of the software.
